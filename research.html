        <h2>Liquid Crystals: A World Between Solid and Liquid</h2>
        <p>
            Liquid crystals represent a fascinating phase of matter, bridging the gap between the ordered world of solids and the chaotic realm of liquids. 
    My research delves deeply into <strong>cholesteric liquid crystals</strong>, known for their unique ability to reflect light and their exquisite sensitivity to external stimuli. 
          These materials exhibit a helical structure in their molecular arrangement, leading to intriguing optical properties and making them vital in numerous applications, 
          from display technologies to biosensors.
        </p>
        <p>
            A particularly captivating aspect of my work lies in exploring the <strong>topology of liquid crystals</strong>.
          This field is about understanding how the orientation and alignment of molecules in liquid crystals can form various structures and patterns. 
          Topology in liquid crystals is not just a theoretical curiosity; it has profound implications for how we can manipulate and utilise these materials in advanced technological applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            My fascination also extends to <strong>exotic defects</strong> within these materials, such as skyrmions and hopfions.
          These defects are not mere imperfections but are rather complex and beautiful structures that embody the intricate dance of molecular alignment. 
          Skyrmions and hopfions, for example, with their unique topological properties, could unlock new potentials in the field of information storage and processing,
          paving the way for futuristic technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The world of liquid crystals is vibrant and endlessly fascinating, offering a window into a realm where science meets art, 
          and where the potential for innovation is boundless. As I continue my research, I am constantly reminded of the beauty and complexity inherent in the world of soft matter physics.
