<!--            <p>Liquid crystals are a state of matter with properties between those of conventional liquids and solid crystals. They are unique in their ability to flow like a liquid but have some degree of ordering, as seen in solid crystals. This dual nature makes them fascinating subjects in theoretical physics, particularly in understanding phase transitions, topological defects, and their applications in modern technology like LCD screens.</p>
            <p>The study of liquid crystals involves exploring their different phases, such as nematic, smectic, and cholesteric, each characterised by varying degrees of order and symmetry. Theoretical models in soft matter physics, including the Landau-de Gennes theory and the Frank free energy framework, provide deep insights into the behaviour of liquid crystals under various conditions.</p>
            <p>My research delves into the topological aspects of liquid crystals, examining how defects and disclinations within these materials can lead to novel physical properties and applications. The interplay between topology and soft matter physics opens up a rich field of study with potential impacts across multiple scientific and technological domains.</p>-->
